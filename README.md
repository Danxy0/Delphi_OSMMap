OSM MapControl
==============

Delphi/Lazarus visual component for displaying a map. Could use any map tile provider (currently implemented OpenStreetMap and HERE). Also includes helper classes for storing and downloading map tiles.
Demo project implements downloading map tiles from network.

:exclamation: **Alpha version, interface could change** :exclamation:

Compatibility
-------------

Tested on:

  - Delphi XE2 and 10.1, VCL, Windows
  - Lazarus 2.1.0 trunk & FPC 3.3.1 trunk, LCL, Windows / Linux

Project structure
-----------------

  - `OSM.SlippyMapUtils` - util functions, variables and types
  - `OSM.TileStorage` - classes `TTileBitmapCache` implementing cache of map tiles organized as a queue and `TTileStorage` implementing disc storage of map tiles.
  - `OSM.NetworkRequest` - utils and classes for network requesting of map tiles. Class `TNetworkRequestQueue` implements threaded non-blocking queue of network requests. Unit doesn't contain any real network request engine.
  - `OSM.NetworkRequest.Synapse`, `OSM.NetworkRequest.WinInet`, `OSM.NetworkRequest.RTL` contain concrete implementations of network requesting routines
  - `OSM.MapControl` contains classes `TMapMark` and `TMapMarkList` for managing a set of map points and `TMapControl` itself
  - `OSM.TilesProvider` - base abstract class of map tile provider.
  - `OSM.TilesProvider.OSM`, `OSM.TilesProvider.HERE` contain concrete implementations of map tile providers
